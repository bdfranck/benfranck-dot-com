I am an Interaction Designer who loves building scrappy prototypes to help diverse teams discover effective designs for intricate digital products and services.

### My Recent Accomplishments

##### I helped NAIT find an effective design for their updated intranet
NAIT was looking to completely redesign their internet. I helped my fellow consultants facilitate meetings with NAIT staff to better understand their needs. I received static mockups and transformed them into an HTML prototype of a potential design of the intranet. I iterated on the prototype based on feedback from stakeholders. I worked with the usability testing team to ensure the prototype was robust enough to be usable for test subjects. The prototype was successfully used in multiple testing sessions.

##### I helped BC Justice find an effective design for a new web application

BC Justice was building a web application to support a key workflow. I visited several offices to observe how staff did their work with paper. From this research I helped create several visual models to help stakeholders understand the opportunities and constraints of the workflow. I created static mockups and HTML prototypes of potential web application designs. I presented each version to workers, business stakeholders, and developers. After many revisions I was able to present a prototype that balanced both the needs of the users, the organization, and the development team.

##### I helped Alberta Land Titles find an effective design for a new web application

Alberta Land Titles was building a web application to help their workers register legal documents. I began the project by interviewing staff and observing how they processed paper documents. With the resulting research insights I created multiple HTML prototypes. I gave walkthroughs of each version of the prototype with workers, business stakeholders, and developers. After iterating through several ideas I finally reached a design that both met the needs of the staff and the constraints of the technology.
