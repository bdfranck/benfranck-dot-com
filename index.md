I am an Interaction Designer who loves building scrappy prototypes to help diverse teams discover effective designs for their intricate digital products and services.

### My Recent Accomplishments

#### I helped BC Justice find an effective design for a new web application.

BC Justice was building a web application to support a key staff workflow. I visited several offices in BC to observe how staff worked with paper. From this research I helped create several visual models to help stakeholders understand the opportunities and constraints of the workflow. I created static mockups and HTML prototypes of potential designs. I presented each version to staff, stakeholders, and developers. After many revisions I was able to present a prototype that balanced both the needs of the users, the organization, and the development team.

#### I helped NAIT find an effective design for their updated intranet.

NAIT was looking to completely redesign their intranet. I helped my fellow consultants facilitate meetings to better understand user and stakeholder needs. I received static mockups and transformed them into an interactive HTML prototype. NAIT stakeholders reviewed the prototype and I revised it accordingly. I also worked with the usability testing team to ensure the prototype acted realistic enough for test subjects. The prototype was successfully used in multiple usability test sessions.

#### I helped Alberta Land Titles find an effective design for a new web application.

Alberta Land Titles was building a web application to help their workers register legal documents. I began by interviewing staff and observing how they processed paper documents. With the resulting research insights I created multiple HTML prototypes. I gave walkthroughs of each version of the prototype to staff, stakeholders, and developers. After iterating through several ideas I finally reached a design that both met the needs of the staff and the constraints of the technology.
