# Ben Franck

I am a UX Designer at [nForm](https://www.nform.com). I use doodling, interactive prototyping, and usability testing to help teams explore ideas and create solid designs for complex web applications. I love touring on my folding bike, playing narrative-driven video games, and cooking the perfect apple oatmeal pancakes. I'd love to talk with you!
