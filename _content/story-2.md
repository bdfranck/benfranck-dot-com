#### I helped NAIT find an effective design for their updated intranet.

NAIT was looking to completely redesign their intranet. I helped my fellow consultants facilitate meetings to better understand user and stakeholder needs. I received static mockups and transformed them into an interactive HTML prototype. NAIT stakeholders reviewed the prototype and I revised it accordingly. I also worked with the usability testing team to ensure the prototype acted realistic enough for test subjects. The prototype was successfully used in multiple usability test sessions.
